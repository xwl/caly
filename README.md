holiday overview of a calender year
===================================

At the beginning of a year, you might want to (or asked to) plan your
holidays for the year. In order to do that, you want to have an
overview of the public holidays. This is what this extension
does. Originally written by Ivan Kanis.

To use, just add below to your config file:

    (require 'caly)

Then, invoke 'M-x caly'.

Here is a screenshot:

![caly](/caly.png?raw=true "")
